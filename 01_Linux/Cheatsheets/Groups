Groups

The group command tells about the group where current user belongs to.

Syntax:

    groups  




Group File

The /etc/group file defines the group membership. A user can be a member of more than one group.

Syntax:

    /etc/group  


usermod

The group members can be edited with usermod or useradd command. If a group is not listed then by default, usermod command will remove the user from every group of which he is a member. Here, -a (append) option is used to prevent this from happening.

Syntax:

    usermod -a -G <group> <userName>  


gpasswd

Control of group membership can be passed on to another user with gpasswd command.

Syntax:

    gpsswd -A <user> <group>
