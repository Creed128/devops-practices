# Weekly Task Management and Collaboration

Welcome to our weekly task management and collaboration process! We'll be using feature branches and pull requests (PRs) to manage tasks, review code, and maintain a clean and efficient codebase. Here's how it works:

## Feature Branches
- Create a dedicated feature branch for every weekly task.
- Name the feature branches using the following format: **"TASK/01_Linux"** (Replace "01" with the task number and "Linux" with the task description).

## Pull Requests (PRs)
- Once you've completed a task, submit a PR to the main branch.
- We'll review the PRs regularly. You can expect feedback and comments during this process.
- We'll meet weekly via Zoom to discuss progress, address questions, and clarify any concerns. 
- You'll receive a meeting link separately via email.

## Communication
- If you have any questions, concerns, or face difficulties with your tasks, don't hesitate to contact me at creongoukeng@gmail.com.
- I'll try to assist and guide you in the right direction :) 
  

Remember, as Valere would say: HAPPY CODING! ðŸš€
